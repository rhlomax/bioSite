        <h1>About Chuck Yeager</h1>
        <h4>Military</h4>
        <p>
          Yeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. 
          From May 1955 to July 1957 he commanded the F-86H Sabre-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron 
          (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at Hahn AB, Germany, and Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France; 
          and from 1957 to 1960 the F-100D Super Sabre-equipped 1st Fighter Day Squadron 
          (later, while still under Yeager's command, re-designated the 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron) 
          at George Air Force Base, California, and Moron Air Base, Spain.         </p>
        <h4>Test Pilot</h4>
        <p>
          Yeager remained in the Air Force after the war, becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field 
          (now Edwards Air Force Base), following graduation from Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School 
          (Class 46C). After Bell Aircraft test pilot Chalmers "Slick" Goodlin demanded $150,000 ($1.6 million in 2015 dollars) 
          to break the sound "barrier," the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket-powered Bell XS-1 in a NACA program 
          to research high-speed flight.
        </p>
        <p> 
			Such was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges was along the lines of 
			"Yeager better have paid-up insurance." Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs 
			when he fell from a horse. He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went 
			to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond, who taped his ribs. Yeager told only his wife, as well as friend and fellow 
			project pilot Jack Ridley, about the accident. On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not 
			seal the X-1's hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, 
			to allow Yeager to seal the hatch.
